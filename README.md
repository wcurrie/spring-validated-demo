Rubbish code to understand bean validation 1.0 vs 1.1.

Method level validation didn't make it into 1.0:

  http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/validator/4.3/reference/en-US/html/validator-specifics.html#validator-customoptions-methodvalidation
  
  http://beanvalidation.org/1.1/
  
Hibernate validator 4.3.1 is still (and will always be...?) a bean validation 1.0 implementation.
